# Predictive-Maintenance
An internship project from iNeuron.ai. Attempt to create app that predicts the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan jet engine.


## Project Description :
In industry, prognostics and health management are key topics for anticipating asset state and avoiding downtime and breakdowns. Run-to-Failure simulation data from turbofan jet engines is included.

The C-MAPSS software was used to simulate engine degradation. Four separate sets of operational conditions and fault modes were simulated in four different ways. To characterize fault progression, record numerous sensor channels. The Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames provided the data set.

## Main Objective:
The main goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine. RUL is equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last data point in the
test dataset.
